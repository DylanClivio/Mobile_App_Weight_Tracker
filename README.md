# Mobile_App_Weight_Tracker


Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The app allows users to track their weight with daily log entries that are accessible. The app also helps the user meet a specific weight goal and notifies them when they reach it.



What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The app starts with a login screen, there is also a screen to enter the user's weight and a data display screen. The app is designed to be user-friendly and guided. The UI makes it simple for the user to make daily log entries quickly.



How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

The coding strategies for the creation of this app involved in-depth planning with a proposal. The app was broken down into modular components that were coded separately and then combined and tested in Android Studio. These are good practices to incoporate in future code development to ensure functional code and minimal set-backs.



How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

Testing was done constantly throughout the development of the code. Testing revealed small unexpected bugs that occasionally showed up. Developing the code incrementally with thorough testing ensured the prevention of major issues down the road.



Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

Incorporating the database was fun because it required ensuring that the data the user was inputing worked seamlessly with the functionality of the app. The app had to provide the user with their previously entered information which required presenting the information in a table for the user at the bottom of the data entry screen.



In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I think integrating the database demonstrated strong skills in managing data and incorporating the back end with the front end.
